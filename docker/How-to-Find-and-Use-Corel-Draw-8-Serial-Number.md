A serial number is a unique code that identifies your Corel Draw 8 license. It is usually composed of 24 characters, separated by dashes. You can find your serial number in different ways, depending on how you purchased or obtained the software.
 
In this article, we will show you three methods to find your Corel Draw 8 serial number and how to use it to activate your software.
  
## Method 1: Check Your Email Confirmation
 
If you bought Corel Draw 8 online from the official website or an authorized reseller, you should have received an email confirmation with your order details and serial number. Check your inbox and spam folder for an email from Corel or the reseller. The email should contain a link to download the software and a serial number to activate it.
 
To use your serial number, follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install Corel Draw 8 from the link provided in the email.
2. Launch the software and click on "Enter Serial Number" when prompted.
3. Copy and paste your serial number from the email and click on "Activate".
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the activation process.

## Method 2: Check Your CD Sleeve or Box
 
If you bought Corel Draw 8 as a physical product on a CD-ROM, you should have received a CD sleeve or a box with your purchase. The serial number should be printed on a sticker or a label on the CD sleeve or the box. If you have lost or damaged your CD sleeve or box, you may not be able to find your serial number.
 
To use your serial number, follow these steps:

1. Insert the CD-ROM into your computer and run the setup file.
2. Follow the installation wizard and enter your serial number when asked.
3. Click on "Activate" and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the activation process.

## Method 3: Use a Key Finder Software
 
If you have already installed Corel Draw 8 on your computer but have forgotten or lost your serial number, you can use a key finder software to retrieve it. A key finder software is a program that scans your computer's registry and finds the product keys of installed software. One of such programs is EaseUS Key Finder[^2^], which can help you find your Corel Draw 8 serial number in three easy steps:

1. Download and install EaseUS Key Finder from its official website.

### Bonus Tip: How to Get Corel Draw 8 for Free
 
If you don't have a valid serial number for Corel Draw 8, you may be tempted to look for one online or use a crack or a keygen to generate one. However, we strongly advise against doing so, as these methods are illegal, unsafe, and unethical. You may end up downloading malware, viruses, or spyware that can harm your computer or compromise your personal data. You may also face legal consequences for violating Corel's terms of service and intellectual property rights.
